user_description: I'm Danny, nice to meet you! I'm a big computer nerd and the person my parents go to when the internet is slow. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Mathematics at George Mason University. I'm passionate about applications in machine learning, data analysis, and have experience as pseudo sysadmin for my home lab.
